# Banking Client Analysis

In the Banking Client Analysis project, I performed comprehensive data cleaning, processing, and client segmentation using Pandas and executed complex queries with PostgreSQL to derive strategic insights for financial decision-making. The primary objective was to analyze client demographics, investment behaviors, banking relationships, and risk profiles to support personalized banking services.

# Key contributions and techniques:

🧹 Data Cleaning & Processing: Utilized Pandas to handle missing values, standardize data formats, and transform raw client data into an analysis-ready format.

🗃️ Data Retrieval: Wrote efficient PostgreSQL queries to extract specific client information based on conditions like age, income, banking relationship type, and join date.


# 🔍 Advanced Analysis:

Assessed risk-weighted scores per client.

Investigated correlations (e.g., between age and bank loans for Gold clients).

Identified high-net-worth clients for targeted strategies.

# 📌 Business Intelligence Use Cases:

Determined the top-performing investment advisors.

Analyzed property ownership trends.

Evaluated gender-based financial behavior and account distributions.

This project demonstrates my ability to extract actionable insights from structured financial datasets using SQL for precision querying and Pandas for scalable analysis, delivering real value in strategic banking contexts.
